#### Sleeper Fantasy Football Global ####=======================================
# Code will do things which need to be done every time we use Sleeper data

#### Setting Things Up ####=====================================================

# Load libraries
library(jsonlite)       # Pulling down JSON data
library(tidyverse)      # Tools for data analysis
library(glue)           # Sticking strings together

# config

options(digits = 20)

#### Getting Data ####==========================================================

# User information is required to pull league data and will not change ever

user_res <- fromJSON("https://api.sleeper.app/v1/user/ncriswell")
user_id <- user_res$user_id

# player information will only need to be pulled once a day / once each time 
#  this is run regardless of the season or week

player_res <- fromJSON("https://api.sleeper.app/v1/players/nfl")

# There are list elements in this data. That is a problem. Get only the 
#  character and numeric values. Sort of a double lapply here. Not awesome. 
player_res_no_lists <- lapply(player_res,
                              function(m) {
                                m[unlist(lapply(m,
                                                function(n)
                                                  is.character(n) | is.numeric(n)))]
                              })

# Combine this into a simple data frame
# (Note, we are calling from the data.table name space here. We should probably 
#  figure out how to do the rest of the this work in data.table eventually as
#  performance might be an issue as time goes on...)
